## Introduction
Beymani consists of set of Hadoop, Spark and Storm based tools for outlier and anamoly 
detection, which can be used for fraud detection, intrusion detection etc.

## Philosophy
* Simple to use
* Input output in CSV format
* Metadata defined in simple JSON file
* Extremely configurable with tons of configuration knobs

## Algorithms
* Univarite  distribution model
* Multi variate sequence or multi gram distribution model
* Average instance Distance
* Relative instance Density
* Markov chain with sequence data
* Spectral residue for sequence data
* Quantized symbol mapping for sequence data
* Local outlier factor for multivariate data
* Instance clustering
* Sequence clustering
* Change point detection

Project's resource directory has various tutorial documents for the use cases described in
the blogs.
